## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Javascript
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This was one of my first projects in React and I learned a lot using the React framework. Coming from using only HTML and CSS React is a real breath of fresh air and makes developing apps such as this very simple and easy.

### Continued development

For future projects I would very much like to continue working with React and further improve my skills in web development.
